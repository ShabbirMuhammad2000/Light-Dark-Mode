Customization
If you want to customize the color palettes for dark mode and light mode, follow these steps:

Open the styles.css file located in the css directory.

Look for the :root selector, which defines the CSS variables for the color palettes.

Modify the values of the CSS variables to your desired colors for both dark and light modes.

css
:root {
  --primary-bg-color: #ffffff; /* Light mode background color */
  
  --primary-text-color: #000000; /* Light mode text color */
  
  --secondary-bg-color: #333333; /* Dark mode background color */
  
  --secondary-text-color: #ffffff; /* Dark mode text color */
  
  /* Add more CSS variables for additional customization if needed */

Save the changes, and the website will now reflect your custom color palettes.
